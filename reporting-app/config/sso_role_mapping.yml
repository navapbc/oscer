# SSO Role Mapping Configuration
#
# Maps IdP (Identity Provider) groups to OSCER application roles.
# When a user logs in via SSO, their group memberships are checked
# against this configuration to determine their OSCER role.
#
# Configuration:
#   role_mappings: Hash mapping OSCER role names to arrays of IdP group names
#   no_match_behavior: What to do when user's groups don't match any role
#     - "deny": Reject the login (user cannot access OSCER)
#     - "assign_default": Assign the default_role
#   default_role: Role to assign when no_match_behavior is "assign_default"
#
# Notes:
#   - Group matching is case-insensitive
#   - First matching role wins (order matters in this file)
#   - Multiple IdP groups can map to the same OSCER role
#
# IMPORTANT: Role priority is determined by order in this file.
# Roles listed first take precedence when a user belongs to multiple groups.

role_mappings:
  admin:
    - "OSCER-Admin"
    - "CE-Administrators"
  caseworker:
    - "OSCER-Caseworker"
    - "OSCER-Staff"
    - "CE-Staff"

# Options: "deny" or "assign_default"
# - deny: Users without matching groups cannot log in
# - assign_default: Users without matching groups get default_role
no_match_behavior: deny

# Only used when no_match_behavior is "assign_default"
default_role: null
