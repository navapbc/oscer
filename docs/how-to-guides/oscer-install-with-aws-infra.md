# Setting Up OSCER with AWS infra-template

You can find a video of a full install demo here,
This video walks through deploying the OSCER reporting app from scratch using Nava's Platform CLI and infrastructure templates. Starting with an empty Git repository, it demonstrates installing template-infra and template-application-rails, configuring AWS infrastructure, setting up networking with a custom domain and HTTPS certificate, and deploying the application to a dev environment. By the end, the OSCER app is live and accessible at a public URL.
