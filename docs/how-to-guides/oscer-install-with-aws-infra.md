# Setting Up OSCER with AWS infra-template


This [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qZMeN9KWF0JIMOXCLaIGBCbbUGUv8DuR/view?usp=sharing) walks through deploying the OSCER reporting app from scratch using Nava's Platform CLI and infrastructure templates. Starting with an empty Git repository, it demonstrates installing template-infra and template-application-rails, configuring AWS infrastructure, setting up networking with a custom domain and HTTPS certificate, and deploying the application to a dev environment. By the end, the OSCER app is live and accessible at a public URL. You can find a video of a full install demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qZMeN9KWF0JIMOXCLaIGBCbbUGUv8DuR/view?usp=sharing).
