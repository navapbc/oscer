# Usability Study: OSCER Homepage and Reporting Activities

## Background

Work requirements create a real risk of coverage loss, not because people are ineligible, but because the reporting process itself becomes a barrier. Research consistently shows that administrative burden and confusing workflows drive coverage losses even among people who qualify for exemptions or meet requirements.

**Why this matters:** 
- In state's that have implemented work requirements, [thousands of people lost coverage in less than a year](https://www.kff.org/event/how-will-states-implement-medicaid-work-requirements/-), largely due to reporting barriers and not because of eligibility issues
- State's that have implemented work requirements have seen [more on administration than on healthcare delivery](https://www.kff.org/event/how-will-states-implement-medicaid-work-requirements/-)
- CBO analysis estimates 18.5 million people could be subject to work requirements annually, with potential coverage reductions in the millions over time ([KFF summary](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/a-closer-look-at-the-work-requirement-provisions-in-the-2025-federal-budget-reconciliation-law/))
- [CBPP's implementation guidance](https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/a-guide-to-reducing-coverage-losses-through-effective-implementation-of-medicaids) emphasizes that red tape and unclear processes are primary drivers of inappropriate coverage loss (CBPP

**Most importantly:** Most people who lose coverage under work requirements are actually exempt, they just don't know it or can't navigate the process to claim their exemption.

This usability testing helps us understand whether OSCER makes it genuinely easy for members to:
- Understand what's being asked of them
- Find exemption paths if they qualify
- Successfully report activities if needed
- Complete the process without losing coverage they're entitled to keep

## Goal

Validate that members can successfully navigate OSCER's homepage and reporting flow before states implement the system, ensuring the experience prevents coverage loss rather than causing it.


## Research Focus

- Do members know what to do when they arrive at the homepage?
- Can members who think they're exempt easily find and follow that path?
- Do members understand what "Community Engagement" means and what's being asked of them?
- Can members successfully navigate from the homepage through the full flow to report activities?
- Is the exemption language clear enough for members to know if they might qualify?
- Where do members get confused or stuck in the flow?

## Participant Screener

### Include (must answer YES)
- Are you between 19-64 years old?
- Do you currently receive free or low-cost health insurance from your state (like Medicaid, MassHealth, OHP, or Medi-Cal), or have you received it in the past 2 years?

- Have you ever had to submit proof of hours or other documentation to keep your health insurance or government benefits?


## Testing Protocol

### Section 1: Warm-Up (2 min)

**Task 1 — Verbal Response**

Before we look at anything, tell me: Have you ever had to submit proof of hours or income worked to keep your health insurance or government benefits? What was that experience like?

**Task 2 — Verbal Response**

On a scale of 1-5 (1 = not comfortable, 5 = very comfortable), how comfortable are you navigating government websites?

---

### Section 2: First Impressions (3 min)

**Task 3 — Show landing page**

Take a look at this page. Don't click anything yet.

**Task 4 — Verbal Response**

In your own words, what do you think this page is for? What is it asking you to do? What's the important information this page is trying to tell you?

**Task 5 — Verbal Response**

Look at the phrase "Community Engagement." What does that mean to you?

**Task 6 — Verbal Response**

In the first portion of the page, in the dark blue and grey portions, read the content in those boxes. What does the phrase "... or find out if you qualify for an exemption" mean to you?

---

### Section 3: Scenario A — New Member (3 min)

**Task 8 — Read scenario, then verbal response**

Now we'll look at some scenarios.

Imagine this: You just received a letter in the mail or an email saying you need to show proof of your work hours or income to keep your Medicaid coverage. You've never done this before.

Looking at this page, what would you do first? Don't click anything, just talk out loud.

**Task 9 — Verbal Response**

What questions do you still have after looking at this page?

**Task 10 — Verbal Response**

What does "80 hours" mean and what counts toward it?

---

### Section 4: Task — Enter Exemption Screener (2 min)

**Task 11 — Read scenario, verbal response**

Now I'd like you to complete a task. Imagine that you think you could be excused from having to submit your work hours and/or income to keep your Medicaid coverage. Verbally respond, don't click yet: where would you go if you wanted to find out if you could be excused from submitting your work hours and/or income?

**Task 12 — Read scenario, complete a task**

Now click "Get started".

You'll be taken to a "Self-assessment, Tell us about your situation" page. Think out loud—tell me what you're seeing, what you're thinking, and if anything is confusing. What did you think about that screen? Talk through what you might do.

---

### Section 5: Task — Report Activities (8 min)

**Task 13 — Read scenario, then verbal response**

Imagine you do not meet any of the exemption scenarios. Imagine you worked 80 hours last month and need to submit your work hours or income to keep your Medicaid coverage.

Looking at this page, try to submit your work hours. Don't click anything yet. Where would you click and what would you expect to see when you click it?

**Task 14 — Start Report Activities flow**

Now I'd like you to complete a task. Click "Report activities".

**Task 15 — Read the flow and complete adding activities**

Now go through the steps on your own as you might in a real life situation. It's OK if you cannot complete the process. We want to understand how your experience is. Speak out loud as you go through each step or page. Tell me what you're seeing, what you're thinking, and if anything is confusing or unclear.

In step 3, you will need to upload a document. You can use the document provided or upload any dummy document type (PDF, .doc, png).

Don't spend more than 7 min on this portion of the test.

Once you're finished, we'll move on to a couple wrap up and closing questions.

---

### Section 6: Wrap-Up (2 min)

**Task 16 — Rating Scale (1-5)**

On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you that you could successfully complete this process and keep your coverage? (1 = Not confident at all, 5 = Very confident)

**Task 17 — Verbal Response**

Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share?

**Next Steps:** Continuing iterative testing as we refine terminology, information architecture, and post-submission experience.
