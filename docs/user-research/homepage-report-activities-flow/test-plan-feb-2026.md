# Usability testing 2: OSCER homepage entry point

## Background
We want to validate the current OSCER homepage entry point before investing in high-fidelity V2 design prototypes or engineering effort. By testing the current landing page and document uploader now, we can identify immediate friction points in how members interpret their reporting requirements and the exemption process.
We need to determine if this layout successfully guides users toward the correct action based on their specific situation (e.g., needing to report hours vs. being eligible for an exemption).

**Why this matters:** A significant number of members who lose coverage under work requirements are actually exempt but fail to navigate the reporting process successfully. This research helps us ensure the homepage acts as a clear signpost, reducing the risk of members losing health insurance due to administrative confusion rather than a lack of eligibility.

**Goal:** Understand how members perceive, interpret, and navigate the current OSCER landing page across different scenarios to inform future design iterations.

## Research Questions 
1. When users first land on the site, how clearly do they understand what the program is, who it’s for, and what they need to do next?
2. At what point do users feel ready to proceed into the flow—and what information is critical for that readiness?
3. How do users interpret the term “Community Engagement” versus "work activities"? without additional context?
4. Does expanding on what “Community Engagement” means improve comprehension of required actions?
5. How do users understand the “80-hour” requirement when they first encounter it?
6. Are users able to accurately describe how often the 80-hour requirement applies (e.g., weekly, monthly)?
7. Where in the experience do users expect to learn about requirement frequency, and does the current placement meet that expectation?
8. Do users understand which reporting period they need to report for after reading the updated requirements language?
9. Is the document uploader easy to use and understand?

## Section 0: Intro
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and I’m a Designer/Researcher at Nava. Thank you for participating in this study. We're testing an application that helps people keep their health coverage by reporting work hours or finding out if they're excused from reporting. There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to understand your experience. We’ll go through the prompts, think out loud as you go through the tasks, sharing what you're seeing, thinking, and feeling. Your honest feedback will help us make this easier for people like you.

With your approval, we would like to record this session for our internal team and only for research purposes. No recordings will be shared outside of our immediate team. Everything you tell us will be confidential, and any direct quotes or insights we share will not be attached to your name or contain identifying information. 

## Section 1: Warm-Up 
**Task 1 — Verbal Response**
Before we look at anything, tell me: Have you ever had to submit proof of hours or income worked to keep your health insurance or government benefits? What was that experience like?
**Task 2 — Verbal Response**
On a scale of 1-5 (1 = not comfortable, 5 = very comfortable), how comfortable are you navigating government websites?

## Section 2: First Impressions
Today we will be looking at a couple pages of a website. I will share my screen and act as your hands, and you will take on the “Driver role” by telling me where to click and what to do.

**Task 3 — Show landing page screenshot/URL**
[Show landing page]

**Task 4 — Verbal Response**
In your own words, what do you think this page is for? What is it asking you to do? What’s the important information this page is trying to tell you? What would you do first?

**Task 5 — Verbal Response**
Look at the phrase "Community Engagement activities." at the bottom of the screen. (under accordion) What does that mean to you?	

## Section 3: Scenario A — New Member, ex parte found

**Task 8 — Read scenario, then verbal response**
Now we’ll look at some scenarios.
Imagine this: You just received a letter in the mail or an email saying you need to show proof of your work hours or income to keep your Medicaid coverage. You've never done this before. 

**Task 9 — Verbal Response**
What questions do you still have after looking at this page?

**Task 10 — Verbal Response**
Which dates do you need to report for? 

**Task 11 — Verbal Response**
Where would you expect to go if you clicked “Continue reporting activities”? 
What about “review previous activity reports”?

## Section 4: Task — Enter Exemption Screener (3 min)

**Task 11 — Read scenario, verbal response**
Now I'd like you to complete a task. Imagine that you think you could be excused from having to submit your work hours and/or income to keep your Medicaid coverage. Where would you go if you wanted to find out if you could be excused from submitting your work hours and/or income. 
[Once they find the correct tab] 
What would you expect to happen if you clicked “request an exemption”?
[After they click] Tell me about this page.

Probe as needed as they explore the page:
* What does exemption mean to you?
* What would you expect to see when clicking “Request an exemption”?
* What would you expect to see when clicking “Enter exemption screener”?

**Task 13 —Start Report Activities flow**
Let’s say you don’t qualify for an exemption.
Now go through the steps on your own as you might in a real life situation. It’s OK if you cannot complete the process. We want to understand how your experience is. Speak out loud as you go through each step or page. Tell me what you're seeing, what you're thinking, and if anything is confusing or unclear.  
Once you’re finished, we’ll move on to a couple wrap up and closing questions. 
Possible questions as they navigate through the screens:

**Activity Report Page**
* What is the table telling you?
* Based on what you see, where do you think these hours came from?

**Supporting documents**
* Tell me more about this 
* What do you think this screen is asking you to do? 
* What would count as acceptable proof?
* What would you do first?
* What documents do you think would be acceptable here?
* Why do you think the system is asking for documents?


## Section 6: Wrap-Up (2 min)
**Task 16 — Rating Scale (1-5)**
On a scale of 1-5, how confident are you that you could successfully complete this process and keep your coverage? (1 = Not confident at all, 5 = Very confident)

**Task 17 — Verbal Response**
Any other thoughts or feedback you'd like to share or magic wand?
