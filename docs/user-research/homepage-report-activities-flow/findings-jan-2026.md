# Usability 1: OSCER homepage and report activities findings

## Introduction
This document outlines the findings and recommendations derived from the moderated usability testing of the OSCER landing page and activity reporting flow. 

## Methodology
**Format:** Moderated usability testing with 5 participants.  
**Scenarios:** Users were asked to evaluate the homepage, review exemption criteria, and submit work hours or income.  
**Key Tasks:** Identify site purpose, define "Community Engagement”, enter the exemption screener, and report activities.

## Key Insights

### Homepage information architecture & comprehension
Initial testing showed the homepage did not quite meet user expectations, however the purpose of the page was eventually understood. 
* Multiple users mentioned wanting a more personalized experience (e.g., being welcomed by name).
* Expectations around the “Get started” button had mixed answers.
* Most users expected more out of the information on the homepage. Topics that were brought up were: more information on what the site/program is about before asking them to take action, exemption types.

### Terminology: “Community engagement”
The term "Community Engagement" was a significant barrier. Users did not understand what this meant initially. 
* Although initially the term “community engagement” was not understood, about half of users did find that “community engagement activities” meant reporting hours and/or income.

### Document uploader is not intuitive.
When reporting activities, the document uploader CTA buttons and process confused users.
* Two users thought that the document was uploaded as soon as they “selected” it, instead of after clicking the “upload document” button.
* One user thought the “upload document” button was the file selector

### The "80-Hour" Requirement Context
The requirement was clear in number but vague in frequency.
* Users were unsure if the 80 hours were monthly, one-time, or cumulative.
* There was also confusion about whether this requirement is ongoing or temporary.

## Secondary Insights

### Successful UI Patterns
**Progress Indicators:** Step indicators (e.g., "1 of 5") significantly reduced anxiety. One participant noted, *"I love when there's bars... there's hope that it's going to end."*

**"Before You Start" Screens:** Most users valued knowing the time estimate and required documents before beginning.

**Save and Return:** The ability to save progress was consistently praised, allowing users to find documents without losing their work.

### Visual Design
* The overall visual design was deemed clean, uncluttered, and easy to scan.

## Conclusion
While all five participants successfully submitted reports within 5 minutes, the path to get there was hindered by confusing terminology and a lack of upfront context. By switching to "Work Reporting Portal" and surfacing exemption criteria earlier, OSCER can significantly reduce the risk of eligible members losing coverage. The successful use of progress bars and "Save and Return" features should be maintained as core pillars of the user experience.
