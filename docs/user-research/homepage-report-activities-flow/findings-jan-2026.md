# Usability 1: OSCER homepage and report activities findings

## Introduction
This document outlines the findings and recommendations derived from the moderated usability testing of the OSCER landing page and activity reporting flow. 

## Methodology
**Format:** Moderated usability testing with 5 participants.  
**Scenarios:** Users were asked to evaluate the homepage, review exemption criteria, and submit work hours or income.  
**Key Tasks:** Identify site purpose, define "Community Engagement”, enter the exemption screener, and report activities.  

## Key Insights

### Homepage information architecture & comprehension
Initial testing showed the homepage did not quite meet user expectations, however the purpose of the page was eventually understood. 
* Multiple users mentioned wanting a more personalized experience (e.g., being welcomed by name).
* Expectations around the “Get started” button to enter the Exemption Screener had mixed answers.
* Most users expected more context before taking action. They expected the homepage to explain what the site/program is and provide information about exemption types before they took any action.

### Terminology: “Community engagement”
The term "Community Engagement" was a significant barrier. Users did not understand what this meant initially. 
* Although the term 'community engagement' was initially unclear to users,  about half were able to understand that 'community engagement activities' meant reporting hours and/or income after reading additional context on the page.

### Document uploader is not intuitive.
When reporting activities, the document uploader CTA buttons and process confused users.
* Two users thought that the document was uploaded as soon as they “selected” it, instead of after clicking the “upload document” button.
* One user thought the “upload document” button was the file selector

### The "80-Hour" Requirement Context
The requirement was clear in number but vague in frequency.
* Users were unsure if the 80 hours were monthly, one-time, or cumulative.
* There was also confusion about whether this requirement is ongoing or temporary.

## Secondary Insights

### Successful UI Patterns
**Progress Indicators:** Step indicators (e.g., "1 of 5") significantly reduced anxiety. One participant noted, *"I love when there's bars... there's hope that it's going to end."*

**"Before You Start" Screens:** Most users valued knowing the time estimate and required documents before beginning.

**Save and Return:** The ability to save progress was consistently praised, allowing users to find documents without losing their work.

### Visual Design
The overall visual design was deemed clean, uncluttered, and easy to scan.

## Opportunities
### Refine value proposition & personalization
**Contextual Onboarding:** Surface the "what, why, and how" of the program immediately upon landing. Users expect to understand the site's purpose before clicking "Get Started." Consider using more descriptive language for "Get Started"

**Logged-in State Personalization:** Address the desire for a more personalized experience by including a named greeting (e.g., "Hi, [Name]") to signal that the user is in the right place.

### Standardize terminology
**"Community Engagement" is jargon to users:** Since this term was a primary barrier, replace it with more direct, action-oriented language such as "Work and Income Reporting" or "Activity Reporting." 

**Clarify the "80-Hour" Requirement:** Explicitly define the frequency of the requirement on the homepage and within the reporting flow. 

### Redesign the Document Uploader
**Improve Uploader Usability:** To prevent users from thinking a file is uploaded as soon as it is selected, consider using a disabled state for the "Upload Documents" button until a document is selected. Other improvements to consider: adding more space between the "Upload Documents" button and the "Continue" button, swapping the button type (primary vs outline) between the two buttons to maintain consistency.

## Conclusion
While all five participants successfully submitted reports within 5 minutes, the path to get there was hindered by confusing terminology and a lack of upfront context. By switching to "Work Reporting Portal" and surfacing exemption criteria earlier, OSCER can significantly reduce the risk of eligible members losing coverage. The successful use of progress bars and "Save and Return" features should be maintained as core pillars of the user experience.
